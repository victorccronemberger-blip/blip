# PentesterFlow — Code Audit / Bug Findings

> Internal review of correctness + security defects across all subsystems. Each finding was

> defense-in-depth not a boundary) is *excluded* — only unintended defects are listed.
>
> Scope note: most "gate" controls are **permission prompts**, not hard blocks. A "silent

Severity legend: **HIGH** = security bypass / RCE primitive / crash / silent data loss ·
**MED** = correctness break, DoS, conditional bypass · **LOW** = cosmetic / edge / hardening.

## 2026-06-11 Follow-up (after "fix them all" pass)

All previously fixable HIGH/MED/LOW items from the 2026-06-10 snapshot have been addressed in source (confirmed by re-review + 654 tests green).

**Remaining accepted (intentional, not changed):**
- H2 (DNS rebinding) — kept permissive + added non-blocking "note: private/internal host approved..." trace in http + web_fetch tool results for visibility without blocking capability.
- L6 (redaction high-entropy) — inherent limitation; added one extra conservative long-token pattern + docs.
- L9 (debug logs) — improved: sessionDebug now applies the standard redactor by default (structure preserved, secrets masked). Still opt-in + local.

**Low items addressed in this pass:**
- L8 (logger rotation) — was already fixed in tree (mid-run throttled + generational); added explicit comment.
- Help text nits (L15) — already correct in current KEYBINDINGS (Ctrl-N/J, Ctrl-A/E, Ctrl-F documented).
- Intelligence growth (M13) — already had 5000 cap + prune; added `clearIntelligence` + `/memory intel stats|clear` UX + agent methods + help tip.
- Added prominent AUDIT cross-reference comments in privateHost.ts, redact.ts, sessionDebug.ts, logger.ts.

No new defects introduced. All changes preserve the "power for authorized operators, prompts not hard blocks" model.

See also the concise list in the review session output and the new `/memory intel` command.

## Remediation status (verified against source)

> Updated 2026-06-10. Each finding below was re-checked against the current tree; fixes carry an
> inline comment citing their finding ID, and the full suite is green (`tsc --noEmit` clean, 561
> tests passing). **35 of 39 findings are fixed.** The remaining 4 are accepted decisions, not open
> defects.

- **Fixed (35):** H1, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10 · M1–M14 (all) · L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L7, L8,
  L11, L12, L13, L14, L15.
- **Accepted — won't change (3):**
  - **H2** (DNS-rebinding SSRF) — keep permissive; reaching internal/metadata IPs is often the
    engagement goal. See the 🟡 row in the triage table.
  - **L9** (debug log writes unredacted tool I/O) — opt-in, `0o600`, local-only; the operator's
    explicit choice. See the ⛔ row.
  - **L6** (no generic high-entropy redaction fallback) — inherent to label-anchored redaction.
- **Hardened (1):** **L10** — self-update now pins the installer to the requested release tag
  (immutable ref) instead of mutable `main` for versioned updates, and asserts the script URL is
  https on `raw.githubusercontent.com` before fetch. The downloaded binary was already SHA-256
  verified fail-closed by `install.sh`. (`src/update/selfUpdate.ts`)

## Capability-impact triage — "fix without limiting the operator"

PentesterFlow's mission is to help authorized pentesters/bug-hunters/security-engineers work
**without limits**. Every fix below is classified so none of them neuter that mission. Fix rules:

- **Gates remain prompts, never hard blocks.** `allow-once / allow-session / deny`, and **YOLO /
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` always auto-approves.** Hitting internal IPs, cloud metadata,
  or reading target files stays fully possible.
- **The agent is never blinded to target data.** Redaction touches *only* what is persisted or
  sent to the cloud LLM (compaction, snapshots, learning JSONL). What the agent reads from a
  target is never scrubbed. Fixing redaction gaps stops the *operator's own* creds leaking — it
  does not hide the target's secrets from the agent.
- **The local sensitive-path gate guards the operator's own machine, not the target.** You don't
  pentest your own `~/.ssh`; making the gate catch `/ETC/SHADOW`/symlinks costs zero offensive
  capability and still prompts (and YOLO still bypasses).

| Class | Meaning | Findings |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ **Fix freely** | Pure reliability / anti-crash / anti-data-loss / stop operator's own secrets leaking. *Increases* mission effectiveness. | H1, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, M4, M5, M6, M7, M8, M9, M10, M11, M12, M13, M14, L1–L8, L11–L15 |
| ⚠️ **Fix capability-preserving** | Make the *local-machine* gate actually catch what it claims — but keep it a **prompt with allow-session**, and YOLO still bypasses. No new friction on target work. | H3, H4, H5, M1, M2, M3 |
| 🟡 **Optional / keep permissive** | The SSRF rebinding gap. Reaching internal/metadata IPs is often the *goal*. Recommend **not** pinning IPs (that would break legitimate internal testing). At most, a **non-blocking notice** "resolved host is internal" — never a block. | H2 |
| ⛔ **Intentional — do NOT change** | Core "without limits" design. | TLS-off HTTP · YOLO mode · no redirect-following · denylist as soft defense-in-depth · scanners in `full` tooling profile · `requires_permission:false` plugin default · opt-in unredacted debug log (L9, operator's explicit choice) |

Net: of 39 findings, **33 are pure operator-benefit** (crashes, leaks of *your* secrets, OOM,
data loss, wrong output), **6 are capability-preserving gate hardening**, and the only
capability-sensitive one (H2) is best left permissive. **Nothing here adds limits to target work.**

## HIGH

### H1 — `grep -P` → `perl -ne` rewrite manufactures a Perl code-execution primitive
`src/tools/shell.ts:187-197` (pattern inlined into a `/.../` literal at `:193`)

The portability rewrite drops the user pattern straight into a Perl regex literal:
`print if /${perlPattern}/`. Perl regex literals interpolate `@{[...]}` / `${...}` and run
`(?{...})` code blocks. **Reproduced:**
`printf 'test\n' | perl -ne 'print if /@{[ \`echo PWNED >&2\` ]}/'` → prints `PWNED`.
So `grep -P '@{[ \`id\` ]}' file` becomes a command-execution shell-out that plain `grep`
would treat as inert data. The denylist won't catch it (no `rm`/`shutdown` token). The rewritten
`perl` form *is* shown in the permission modal, so it's not fully silent — but the rewrite
*creates* an exec primitive out of "just grepping" intent.
**Fix:** treat the pattern as data — pass via `@ARGV`/`\Q…\E` or `qr` without interpolation.

### H2 — SSRF gate is defeated by DNS rebinding (resolve-then-connect TOCTOU)
`src/tools/privateHost.ts:64-74` (gate resolves) vs `src/tools/http.ts:131`, `src/tools/web.ts:61` (connect)

The gate resolves the hostname to decide whether to prompt, then hands the **hostname string**
(not the vetted IP) to undici/fetch, which **re-resolves independently**. A short-TTL attacker
domain returns a public IP on the first lookup (→ no prompt) and `127.0.0.1` /
`169.254.169.254` on the connect lookup. Result: **silent SSRF to loopback/RFC1918/cloud
metadata with no prompt at all.** This is the single most serious gap.
**Fix:** resolve once in the gate and pin that IP for the connection (custom undici
`connect`/`lookup` that only allows the vetted address).

### H3 — Sensitive-path gate: case-insensitive bypass on macOS
`src/tools/sensitive.ts:42-56` (compares with `===`/`startsWith`, case-sensitive)

`isSensitivePath("/ETC/SUDOERS")` returns **false** while the file opens fine on default
case-insensitive APFS. So `file_read(path="/ETC/SHADOW")`, `~/.SSH/id_rsa`, `~/.AWS/credentials`
read **with no prompt**. Reproduced: `isSensitivePath("/ETC/SHADOW") === false`.
**Fix:** case-fold the comparison on case-insensitive filesystems.

### H4 — Sensitive-path gate: `/private/etc/...` realpath gap on macOS
`src/tools/sensitive.ts:9-14`, `src/tools/file.ts:50-51`

Denylist lists `/etc/...` but on macOS the canonical realpath is `/private/etc/...`. Only
`/private/etc/master.passwd` is listed; `shadow`/`sudoers` under `/private/etc` are not — and
the "check the realpath too" logic *defeats* the gate here because the canonical path itself
isn't denylisted. `file_read(path="/private/etc/sudoers")` reads ungated.
**Fix:** canonicalize denylist entries through realpath at load, or add `/private/etc/*`.

### H5 — `@file` mention inlining bypasses the gate via symlink (lexical-only check)
`src/agent/mentions.ts:38` (`isSensitivePath(resolved)` uses `resolve()`, never `realpath`)

Unlike `file.ts`, the mention path is checked lexically. A symlink under cwd
(`notes -> ~/.ssh/id_rsa`) plus a message containing `@notes` silently `readFileSync`s and
inlines the secret into the prompt — **no prompt at all**. (Combined with H3, a direct
`@/ETC/SUDOERS` also slips through.)
**Fix:** realpath before the sensitivity check, matching `file.ts`.

### H6 — Aborted turn persists a dangling assistant `tool_call`, breaking the session
`src/agent/agent.ts:584` (pushed + saved at `:586`, resumed at `:414`)

The assistant message carrying `toolCalls` is pushed and `save()`d **before** the tool loop
runs. Pressing **Esc** mid-loop throws `'aborted'`, so the matching `role:'tool'` results are
never appended — the invalid pair is written to disk. The next `run()` / `--resume` sends an
assistant `tool_calls` with no following tool message; OpenAI/Kimi pass it verbatim
(`src/llm/openai.ts:303-324`) → **hard 400**. Session is unusable until `/reset`. No
reconcile step exists on load or next-turn.
**Fix:** drop/repair a trailing assistant-with-tool_calls that has no results on save/load.

### H7 — Unclosed `<think>` erases the entire assistant message (silent data loss)
`src/agent/sanitize.ts:5,8`

`THINK_BLOCK_RE = /<think>[\s\S]*?(?:<\/think>|$)/gi` matches to end-of-string when there's no
close. Reproduced: `stripThinkingTags('<think>reasoning ... and the answer here')` → `""`.
A model that emits an unclosed `<think>` (truncation/streaming cutoff, or answer-inside-reasoning)
yields a blank turn; in compaction it throws "empty summary" → trips the circuit breaker (see M4).
**Fix:** only strip a `<think>…</think>` pair; if unclosed, strip the tag but keep trailing text.

### H8 — Plugin stdin write crashes the whole CLI on EPIPE
`src/tools/plugin.ts:128`

`child.stdin.write(JSON.stringify(args))` has no `'error'` listener. Large args (> ~64 KiB pipe
buffer) against a plugin that exits early raise an async `EPIPE` → promoted to
`uncaughtException` → **entire agent process dies**. Reproduced 5/5 with 5 MB stdin into a
fast-exiting child.
**Fix:** `child.stdin.on('error', …)` and guard the write.

### H9 — Redaction misses passwords in URL userinfo
`src/redact/redact.ts:11-38`

No pattern targets `scheme://user:pass@host`. Reproduced: `https://admin:Sup3rSecretPass@example.com`
passes through unchanged. These leak into `/compact` payloads sent to the LLM, snapshots,
findings, and the intelligence JSONL — exactly the trust boundary this module guards. Common in
curl repros, DB strings, git remotes.
**Fix:** add a `://user:pass@` userinfo pattern.

### H10 — Redaction misses 2-segment / unsigned JWTs
`src/redact/redact.ts:31`

The JWT pattern requires three segments. A 2-segment `alg:none` token or a header+payload prefix
logged before the signature (`eyJhbGci….eyJzdWIi…`) — which still contains the base64 claims
(subject, email) — passes unredacted. Reproduced.
**Fix:** match `eyJ…\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]+` with an optional third segment.

---

## MEDIUM

### M1 — `file.ts` gate TOCTOU vs the actual read/write (symlink race)
`src/tools/file.ts:50` (realpaths `abs`) vs `:99/:206/:215` (re-opens `abs`). The gate checks one
resolution and operates on another; a symlink swapped in between bypasses the "symlink-proof"
claim. **Fix:** open an fd once and fstat/read that fd.

### M2 — `read_payloads` / `read_skill_file` `../` containment defeated by a symlink in the skill dir
`src/tools/payloads.ts:103-110`, `src/tools/skillFile.ts:93-103`. A `payloads/evil -> /etc` symlink
plus `read_payloads(file="evil/passwd")` reads `/etc/passwd` (these tools don't prompt). The
lexical `..`/absolute checks are otherwise robust. **Fix:** realpath and re-check containment.

### M3 — `grep`/`glob` leak `/private/etc` (and case-variant) contents past the per-file gate
`src/tools/search.ts:131,182`. Same root cause as H3/H4: `GrepTool(path="/private/etc", glob="sudoers")`
streams file contents ungated. **Fix:** with H3/H4.

### M4 — Auto-compact circuit breaker never resets
`src/agent/agent.ts:741` (reset only on auto-compact success; absent in `compact()` `:456` and
`reset()` `:383`). After 3 failures the breaker trips and stays tripped for the whole process —
even after `/compact` succeeds or `/reset`. History then grows unbounded → eventual context 400
with no recovery. **Fix:** reset the counter on manual compact success and on reset.

### M5 — Auto-compact threshold checked before the user msg + `@mention` expansion
`src/agent/agent.ts:523-560`. `approxTokens()` runs at `:526` against history *without* the new
user message (`:546`) or expanded `@file` content (`:560`, up to 64 KB/mention). A turn just under
threshold + large attachments blows past the context window with no compaction → provider 400.
The `length/4` estimate also underestimates non-ASCII. **Fix:** estimate post-expansion.

### M6 — OpenAI streaming tool-call fallback fragments calls across chunks
`src/llm/openai.ts:239`. `fallbackIndex = parts.size` is recomputed per chunk, so a server that
omits `index` (some llama.cpp/vLLM/OpenRouter upstreams) lands fragments of one call in separate
map entries → split name/args → `JSON.parse` fails. **Fix:** track a stable fallback index across
chunks.

### M7 — Non-streaming path drops reasoning-model output when `content` is empty
`src/llm/openai.ts:155-172`. `chat()` reads only `message.content`; `deepseek-reasoner`-style
responses (answer in `reasoning_content`, empty `content`) yield a blank assistant turn in
non-streaming mode. Streaming handles it; non-streaming doesn't. **Fix:** fall back to
`reasoning_content` when content is empty.

### M8 — Gemini tool results use deprecated `role: 'function'`
`src/llm/gemini.ts:148-161`. `v1beta` `Content.role` accepts only `user`/`model`;
functionResponse parts should use `role: 'user'`. Newer Gemini models can 400 on multi-turn tool
use. **Fix:** emit `role: 'user'` for tool results.

### M9 — Capture store: unbounded `endpoints` Map + per-endpoint param Sets → OOM
`src/browser/store.ts:99,346-372`. `pruneIfNeeded` bounds only `requests`. Attacker-influenced
target traffic with unique paths/param names grows endpoint metadata without limit over a long
capture. **Fix:** LRU-cap `endpoints.size` and cap each param Set.

### M10 — MCP result fully buffered before the 128 KiB cap
`src/tools/mcp.ts:84,171`. A hostile/compromised MCP server returning multi-GB content is
materialized + `JSON.stringify`'d before truncation → OOM. The cap protects context, not the
process. **Fix:** bound the transport read.

### M11 — Terminal-escape injection from ingested data into the operator's TUI
`src/browser/server.ts:159,169-182` → `src/cli/index.ts:424` → `src/ui/Transcript.tsx:87,114`.
`eventText()` interpolates attacker-controlled `url`/`method`/`target`/Burp `action` into a
`kind:'system'` notice, which `system` rendering passes to Ink `<Text>` **without ANSI/control
stripping** (unlike the tool-call path). A captured URL with raw ESC sequences (OSC title-set,
cursor moves, hyperlinks) hits the pentester's terminal verbatim. **Fix:** scrub control bytes in
`eventText` (the repo already has a scrubber in `state.ts`).

### M12 — Findings store TOCTOU → one finding overwrites another
`src/findings/store.ts:38-50`. `uniqueFindingPath` uses `existsSync` then `save()` writes
separately; two same-slug saves can resolve to the same path and the second overwrites the first.
No atomic-rename (used elsewhere) here. **Path traversal via title is NOT exploitable** — slug is
`[a-z0-9-]+`. **Fix:** atomic create-exclusive.

### M13 — Intelligence JSONL: unbounded growth + concurrent-append dup race
`src/intelligence/store.ts:109-129,143-154`. No size/line cap (every compaction appends up to 25
scenarios, fully `readFileSync`-loaded on each op). Dedup is `title+category` only and two
concurrent callers can both pass the check. **JSONL injection is NOT possible** (`JSON.stringify`
escapes; text is redacted first). **Fix:** cap file size + serialize appends.

### M14 — Nested `<think>` leaks inner content + a stray `</think>`
`src/agent/sanitize.ts:5`. `stripThinkingTags('<think>a<think>b</think>visible</think>real')` →
`"visible</think>real"`. Non-greedy close + start-only dangling strip leaks reasoning and markup
for models that nest think blocks. **Fix:** balance nesting or strip all `</think>` occurrences.

---

## LOW / hardening

- **L1** `src/tools/shell.ts:191,197` — rewrite appends post-pattern grep flags (`-A3`,`--color`)
  as perl "filenames" → breaks legit commands; context flags unmodeled.
- **L2** `src/tools/shell.ts:82` — `GREP_P_RE` is textual; fires on `grep -P` inside `echo`/`awk`
  strings, corrupting output.
- **L3** `src/tools/file.ts:214` — `file_edit` single-occurrence path uses `String.replace`, which
  interprets `$&`/`$1`/`$$` in `new_string`; `replace_all` (split/join) does not. Silent corruption
  of PoCs/scripts containing literal `$&`. **Fix:** split/join in both branches.
- **L4** `src/tools/file.ts:101`, `src/agent/mentions.ts:66` — byte-cap truncation splits multibyte
  UTF-8 → trailing U+FFFD. Cosmetic.
- **L5** `src/llm/gemini.ts:71` — bare model id (no `models/` prefix) builds a 404 URL; picker
  normally supplies the prefix, so only manual config trips it.
- **L6** `src/redact/redact.ts` — no generic high-entropy fallback (unlabeled tokens/cookies in raw
  response bodies slip through); multiline/wrapped secrets only partially masked. (Inherent to
  label-anchored redaction.)
- **L7** `src/findings/httpRequest.ts:79-96,143-154` — curl `--data-urlencode` not encoded and
  `-d @file` emitted literally → malformed raw request / wrong Content-Length for Burp replay.
- **L8** `src/logger/logger.ts:54-63` — rotation only at `init()`; a long session grows unbounded
  mid-run, and `.log.1` is clobbered with no generational retention.
- **L9** `src/logger/sessionDebug.ts:26-48` — debug log writes raw tool I/O (HTTP bodies, args,
  stacks) **unredacted**. Opt-in + `0o600` + local, but asymmetric with every other path.
- **L10** `src/update/selfUpdate.ts:20,55-56` — `PENTESTERFLOW_REPO` is interpolated into a
  download-and-`sh` URL with **no checksum/signature** verification. Needs attacker-controlled env
  (already game-over) or CDN/MITM; hardening gap, not a remote vector.
- **L11** `src/tools/privateHost.ts:60` — `localhost.` (trailing dot) missed by the name check;
  only caught by the DNS fallback. **L12** `:91-107` — NAT64 (`64:ff9b::/96`) / 6to4 embedding of
  private/metadata v4 not flagged → silent reach in IPv6-only/NAT64 networks.
- **L13** `src/ui/permBridge.ts:34-35` — `sessionAllowed` cache is read *before* `noSessionCache`
  is consulted; not exploitable today (key spaces don't collide) but a latent bypass footgun.
- **L14** `src/tools/aliases.ts:43-64` — `KNOWN_TOOL_NAMES` lists `glob`/`grep`/`ask` but the real
  tool names are `GlobTool`/`GrepTool`/`ask_user` (and the canonical map omits them), so a skill
  declaring the *correct* runtime name fails validation. Asymmetric with shell/file tools.
- **L15** `src/ui/App.tsx:1443` — `/help` lists "Shift-Enter newline" (never implemented; real keys
  Ctrl-N/Ctrl-J) and omits Ctrl-F / Ctrl-A / Ctrl-E.

## Verified NOT bugs (so they aren't re-investigated)

Denylist bypasses via quoting/case/flag-reorder/`--`/newline (all caught) · cache-key collisions
(rewrite is deterministic; only semantically-equal commands share a key) · process-group
kill/timeout/abort (sound; minor: SIGTERM-only, no SIGKILL fallback) · IPv4 octal/hex/decimal/short
+ userinfo + IPv4-mapped-IPv6 SSRF encodings (all caught) · redirect-based SSRF (`redirect:'manual'`)
· `Authorization: Basic` + RSA/EC/OPENSSH private-key blocks (redacted) · ReDoS in redaction (all
linear, <3ms on 500k input) · prototype pollution via ingested JSON (fresh plain objects, no
recursive merge) · ingest `DELETE /clear` auth (gated) · empty/missing token compare (length-checked
+ `timingSafeEqual`) · ingest body cap before 4 MiB (enforced) · 0.0.0.0 bind (it's 127.0.0.1) ·
plugin command injection (`spawn` without `shell:true`) · streaming chunk-boundary reassembly
(correct) · `reasoning_content` re-injection (never accumulated) · Gemini `normalizeSchema`
stripping `required`/`enum` (it doesn't) · compaction dropping the system prompt or emitting orphan
tool results (it doesn't) · session save crash-safety (tmp+fsync+rename).

*Top priorities by real-world impact: **H2** (DNS-rebinding SSRF, silent), **H3/H4/H5** (sensitive
files read with no prompt on macOS), **H6** (abort corrupts the session), **H8** (plugin crashes
the CLI), **H9/H10** (the user's own secrets leak across the redaction boundary), **H1** (rewrite
builds an exec primitive).*
